# Index Fungorum as a Catalogue of Life Data Package (ColDP)

A version of [Index Fungorum](http://www.indexfungorum.org) with persistent identifiers (e.g., DOIs) for literature added. Original data harvested via Index Fungorum API. Persistent identifiers added based on my earlier work [indexfungorum-publications](https://github.com/rdmpage/indexfungorum-publications).
